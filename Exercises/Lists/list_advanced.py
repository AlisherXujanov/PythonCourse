    Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in a given sequence of numbers.
    This function implements dynamic programming to find the length of the longest strictly
    increasing subsequence within the input list of numbers.
    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers to find the longest increasing subsequence in.
    Returns:
        int: The length of the longest increasing subsequence.
    Examples:
        >>> longest_increasing_subsequence([10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18])
        4  # The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 5, 7, 101]
        >>> longest_increasing_subsequence([0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 3])
        4  # The longest increasing subsequence is [0, 1, 2, 3]
        >>> longest_increasing_subsequence([])
        0  # Empty list returns 0
    Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) where n is the length of the input list
    Space Complexity: O(n) for the dynamic programming array
