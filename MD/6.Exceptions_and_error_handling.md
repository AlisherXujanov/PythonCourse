# Errors in Python üò±

Errors in Python can be categorized into three main types:

1. **Compile Time Errors**
     - **Example:** Syntax error
     - **Description:** These errors occur when the code does not follow the correct syntax of the Python language.
     - **Example Code:**
       ```python
       print('Hello world
       ```

2. **Logical Errors**
     - **Example:** 2 + 2 == 5 ?
     - **Description:** These errors occur when the code runs without crashing but produces incorrect results.
     - **Example Code:**
       ```python
       result = 2 + 2
       if result == 5:
               print("This is incorrect logic")
       ```

3. **Run Time Errors**
     - **Example:** 1/0
     - **Description:** These errors occur during the execution of the program.
     - **Example Code:**
       ```python
       print(1 / 0)
       ```

# Error Types üõë

Here are some common error types in Python:

1. **SyntaxError**
     - **Description:** Occurs when the parser encounters a syntax error.
     - **Example Code:**
       ```python
       print('Hello world)
       ```

2. **TypeError**
     - **Description:** Occurs when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.
     - **Example Code:**
       ```python
       print(1 + 'Hello world')
       ```

3. **NameError**
     - **Description:** Occurs when a local or global name is not found.
     - **Example Code:**
       ```python
       print(x)
       ```

4. **IndexError**
     - **Description:** Occurs when a sequence subscript is out of range.
     - **Example Code:**
       ```python
       print([1, 2, 3][3])
       ```

5. **ValueError**
     - **Description:** Occurs when a function receives an argument of the right type but inappropriate value.
     - **Example Code:**
       ```python
       print(int('Hello world'))
       ```

6. **KeyError**
     - **Description:** Occurs when a dictionary key is not found.
     - **Example Code:**
       ```python
       print({'a': 1}['b'])
       ```

7. **AttributeError**
     - **Description:** Occurs when an attribute reference or assignment fails.
     - **Example Code:**
       ```python
       print('Hello'.append('!'))
       ```

8. **ZeroDivisionError**
     - **Description:** Occurs when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero.
     - **Example Code:**
       ```python
       print(1 / 0)
       ```

9. **ImportError**
     - **Description:** Occurs when an import statement fails to find the module definition or when a from ... import fails to find a name that is to be imported.
     - **Example Code:**
       ```python
       import test
       ```

10. **IndentationError**
      - **Description:** Occurs when the indentation is not correct.
      - **Example Code:**
          ```python
          def func():
          print("Hello")
          ```

# Using the `raise` Keyword üöÄ

The `raise` keyword is used to manually raise an exception in Python.
We can sometimes raise exceptions based on certain conditions in our code to ensure that the program behaves as expected and otherwise raises an error to prevent further execution.

**Example Code:**
```python
def my_fn(x: int) -> int:
      if type(x) != int:
            raise TypeError('Bemiyya!!! Nomer yoz!!!')
      return x * x

print(my_fn(10))
```

# Exception Handling in Python üõ†Ô∏è

In Python, exceptions are handled using the `try` and `except` blocks.

**Example Code:**
```python
x = 2
z = "123"

print("BEFORE ...")
try:
      print(x / z)
except ZeroDivisionError as error:
      print("–ù–µ–ª—å–∑—è –¥–µ–ª–∏—Ç—å –Ω–∞ –Ω–æ–ª—å! - ", error)
except Exception as error:
      print("–í–æ–æ–±—â–µ –Ω–µ –ø–æ–Ω—è–ª - ", error)

print("AFTER ...")
```

## Multiple Exceptions üéØ

You can handle multiple exceptions by specifying them as a tuple in the `except` block.

**Example Code:**
```python
try:
      print(x)
except (NameError, TypeError) as e:
      print('–ü–µ—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –Ω–µ –æ–±—ä—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∞')
```

## The `finally` Block üîí

The `finally` block is executed no matter what, whether an exception is raised or not.

**Example Code:**
```python
try:
      print("open file")
      print(2 / 0)
except Exception as e:
      print(e)
finally:
      print("close file")
```

### `NOTE`: 

**`Do NOT overuse try-except`** blocks. They should be used to handle exceptions that you expect to occur. Do not use them to handle all exceptions in your code. It is better to let the program crash and fix the root cause of the error.

# Ternary Operator in Python üé≤

The ternary operator in Python allows you to write a simple if-else statement in one line.

**Example Code:**
```python
print(True) if 2 == 2 else print(False)
```

# Generators üîÑ

Generators are a simple way of creating iterators. They allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator.
The main reason for using a generator is that it is more memory-efficient than creating a list of the same elements.
For example, if you need to iterate over a large number of elements, it is better to use a generator instead of a list. 
By using a generator, you can iterate over the elements one by one without storing them all in memory at once.

**Example Code:**
```python
def fibonacci(n):
      a, b = 0, 1
      for _ in range(n):
            yield a
            a, b = b, a + b

# Create a generator for the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
fib = fibonacci(10)

# Print the Fibonacci numbers
for num in fib:
      print(num)
```

In this example, the `fibonacci` function is a generator that yields the first `n` Fibonacci numbers. We create a generator `fib` for the first 10 Fibonacci numbers, and then we use a for loop to print each number. This is more memory-efficient than creating a list of the first `n` Fibonacci numbers, especially for large `n`.
