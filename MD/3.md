# Python Built-in Data Types

Python has several built-in data types. Here are the most commonly used ones:

- **Numeric Types**: `int`, `float`, `complex`
- **Sequence Types**: `list`, `tuple`, `range`
- **Text Sequence Type**: `str`
- **Binary Sequence Types**: `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`
- **Set Types**: `set`, `frozenset`
- **Mapping Type**: `dict`
- **Boolean Type**: `bool`
- **None Type**: `None`

## Boolean Type

#### `bool()`

In short, things devide into two categories: `True` and `False`  or we could say "Positive" and "Negative". <br>
Anything that exists is `True` for Python, and anything that doesn't exist is `False`.

```Negatives```
- False
- None
- 0,  0.0,  ''
- [], (), {}


The `bool()` function converts a value into a corresponding boolean value.

```python
print(bool(0))  # False
print(bool(1))  # True
print(bool([]))  # False
print(bool([1, 2, 3]))  # True
...
```

For our computer, everything consists of 0s and 1s. So, when we convert a value to a boolean, we are essentially converting it to a 0 or 1. Therefore, `True` is 1 and `False` is 0.



## If / Elif / Else in Python

The `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements are used for decision-making in Python. They allow you to execute certain pieces of code based on conditions.

- **`if`**: Checks a condition. If it's `True`, it runs the code inside.
- **`elif`**: Stands for "else if". It checks another condition if the previous `if` or `elif` was `False`.
- **`else`**: Runs if none of the previous conditions were `True`.


### Beginner Example

```python
# Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero
number = 10

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif number < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")
```

### Advanced Example
```python
# Determine the grade based on a score
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    grade = 'A'
elif score >= 80:
    grade = 'B'
elif score >= 70:
    grade = 'C'
elif score >= 60:
    grade = 'D'
else:
    grade = 'F'

print(f'The grade is {grade}.')
```



### match / case

Match-case, is essentially a switch-case statement in Python. It helps you write cleaner code by avoiding multiple `if-elif-else` statements. Also, it's more readable and easier to understand. However, 

```python
HTTPS_status = 200
match HTTPS_status:
    case 200 | 201:
        print('OK')
    case 404:
        print('Not found')
    case 301 | 302:
        print('Redirect')
    case _:
        print('Unknown')
```

## Exercises with explanations

### 1. Swap first and last digits of a number

**RU**: Поменяйте местами первую и последнюю цифры числа.

```python
x = 123456789
x = str(x)
print(int(x[-1] + x[1:-1] + x[0]))
```

### 2. Check if a string is a palindrome

**RU**:  Найти зеркальное число или текст.
```python
inp = input("What is your name: ")
print(inp[::-1])
print(str(num)[::-1])
```

```python
def is_polindrome(arg) -> bool:
    if type(arg) == int:
        arg = str(arg)
    return arg == arg[::-1]

print(is_polindrome(input('Guess a polindrome: ')))
```
