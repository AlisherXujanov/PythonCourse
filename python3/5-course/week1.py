# By using Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), you will create a program called _WordyPy_. In WordyPy, the bot you create
# must try to guess a five-letter secret word based on feedback given from the game engine. For each word guess your bot
# makes, the WordyPy game engine will give detailed feedback which your bot can use to increase its chances of winning.

# # Requirements

# The rules of WordyPy are as follows:

# 1. Each guess must be a five letter English word. Only the 26 letters of the English alphabet are used, and case does
#    not matter.
# 2. The game engine, which is written for you, generates a hidden 5 letter word called the _target word_.
# 3. The bot, which you must write, attempts to guess that word. It will get up to six tries.
# 4. The bot will be given the location of a datafile which has a list of allowable words(one per line). Your bot must
#    read in this datafile and only make guesses from this datafile.
# 5. After each guess the system provides feedback indicating if each character is in the correct position for the target
#    word, and if not, if the character is in the target word but in the wrong position.
# 6. The bot must be "smart" in that once it has identified the correct location of a letter in a word it must only guess
#    future words where that letter is in the same position.
# 7. We have written tests for these requirements; you must pass those tests to pass the assignment.

# # Architecture

# In order for your bot to play WordPy, you must implement two classes shown in the figure below(`Letter` and `Bot`) and
# write the python logic for each method of the two classes.

# ![Architecture Diagram of WordyPy](architecture.png)

# A `Letter` indicates a single English letter from a guess, and has methods and attributes to describe whether the letter
# was in (or in the correct place) in the hidden target word.

# The `Bot` class is your game playing agent! This class has two substantive methods in it:

# 1. `make_guess` which returns a string that is evaluated by the `GameEngine` and
# 2. `record_guess_results` which takes the evaluation done by the `GameEngine` in order to ensure that the same guess is
#    never made twice ** and ** that your bot "learns" from previous guesses.

# The `GameEngine`, given to you at the bottom of this notebook, will control the game play. You don't have to write the
# `GameEngine` â€“ we've done that for you. However, the `GameEngine` will not work until you have correctly defined the
# `Letter` and `Bot` classess, including their methods. You will work on those!

# ## How to Test Your Bot

# Once you have created the neccessary classes you should be able to test your bot by running this notebook. To verify it
# is passing our grading criteria, press the validate button on the toolbar. Once you have verified this you can try
# submitting to the autograder, which will evaluate our additional hidden unit tests and give you a grade -- don't worry,
# you can submit to the autograder as many times as you would like!

# You may wish to debug your `Bot` by playing a game with a shorter word list. We've included code for that at the bottom
# of this notebook for testing, but be aware that it will not work until your `Letter` and `Bot` classes have been
# implemented. Also, our final grader script will use a bigger dictionary of allowable words, so make sure you are
# thinking more generally about the problem and not hard coding any example words into your work!

# ## Worked Example

# Here is the output from an example run using the testing code provided. In this example five words were put into a text
# file called temp_file.txt. The game engine randomly picked a target word of `DOGGY` and the bot made three guesses.

# 1. The first guess was the word `DRIVE` and the GameEngine provides the output of `D????` indicating that the first
#    letter is in the word and is in the correct position and the last four letters are not in the word anywhere.
# 2. The bot then made the guess of `DADDY` and the GameEngine provides the output of `D?**Y` indicating that the first
#    and the last letters are in the word and in the correct location, the second letter from `DADDY` is not in the word
#    anywhere, and the third and fourth letters from `DADDY` are in the target word but not in those positions.
# 3. The final guess made by the bot is the word `DOGGY`, which the game engine identifies as correct and finishes
#    **WordyPy**.


# **Hint 1: Don't forget the Types!**

# In the architecture diagram we have used the format that python uses for type annotations. For example, in the `Letter`
# class, there are three methods. The constructor method, `__init__`, takes two input parameters, `letter`, which is of
# type `string`, and `index`, which is of type `integer`. The `__init__` method returns `None`. The diagram also indicates
# that the third attribute, `in_word`, is a boolean value and has a default value of `False` and you need to set this
# value appropriately.

# For a refresher on interpreting these type annotations, please consult [TODO: INCLUDE LINK TO COURSE 2 MATERIAL ON TYPE
# HINTING HERE]

# **Hint 2: Planning your Approach**

# It can be a bit overwhelming to tackle the whole assignment at one time, so consider breaking it down into steps. The
# steps I would take with this assignment would be:

# 1. Create the `Letter` class and ensure it passes all of the tests (both validation and assignment grading tests)
# 2. Create an initial `Bot` class based on the architecture diagram
# 3. Update the `Bot` class to make random guesses with the test words I provided
# 4. Update the `Bot` class to track the letters whose positions are identified correctly
# 5. Update the `Bot` class to track the letters which are not used at all and not use them in the next guesses. In short,
#    ensure it keeps track of past guesses and makes a **"smart"** guess


# **Hint 3: Considering an Algorithm for Smart Guesses**

# One of the hardest parts of this assignment is making a "smart" guess. The assignment requires your bot to keep track of
# what it has learned, and the `GameEngine` provides feedback to your bot using the `record_guess_results()` method. In
# solving this part of the assignment consider the following:

# 1. You only need to keep track of which `Letter` objects have an `is_in_correct_place()` of `True`, so feel free to
#    ignore other information about `Letter` objects such as whether `is_in_word()` is true
# 2. You don't need to keep track of all of your previous guesses if they are removed from your `word_list`
# 3. You may want to add additional attributes to your `Bot` which don't appear in the architecture diagram
